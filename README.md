An open crypto concept that reflects wasted energy and time in lost blockchain assets.
# ClockCoin (CLC) – Preserve the Value of Time and Energy

ClockCoin is a conceptual smart cryptocurrency designed to preserve the value of lost or idle digital assets by representing the energy, time, and computational resources wasted in forgotten or inaccessible coins.

In a world where millions of cryptocurrencies are lost forever due to forgotten keys or abandoned wallets, ClockCoin introduces a new paradigm — one where every second and every joule has value. By tokenizing the lost potential of these dormant assets, ClockCoin becomes a symbol of digital continuity and accountability.
