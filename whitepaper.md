# 🕒 ClockCoin (CLC) – Whitepaper (Draft v0.1)

## 🧠 Project Concept:

In the world of cryptocurrencies, a huge amount of value is lost due to forgotten or inaccessible wallets.  
**ClockCoin** is a smart digital currency project that aims to **preserve the value of lost time and energy**, by linking a wallet’s value to its last active timestamp.

---

## 🎯 Objective:

- Protect unused digital value from economic decay.
- Link cryptocurrencies to time as an irretrievable energy.
- Re-activate dormant wallets through intelligent incentives.

---

## ⛓ Proposed Mechanism:

- Every CLC wallet stores a last active timestamp.
- A "Dormancy Index" is calculated based on inactivity duration.
- Smart mechanisms activate:
  - Gradual **reduction in spending power** of inactive wallets.
  - **Incentives for active wallets** through time-based rewards.
  - Optional “proof-of-presence” via regular signed check-ins.

---

## 🧱 Technical Structure:

- Initially launched as a **token on BNB Chain** (for simplicity).
- Later migration to a custom blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin fork or Cosmos SDK).
- Integration of **timestamp signing** per wallet.
- Time-based wallet states affect fees, rewards, privileges.

---

## 🔁 Future Use Cases:

- In **digital markets**: encourage flow over hoarding.
- In **energy platforms**: link value to saved effort/time.
- In **activity-proof systems**: time as unit of participation.

---

## 💡 Philosophical Vision:

> "Lost coins = dead time + wasted energy.  
> ClockCoin wants to reset the clock."

Instead of memoryless coins, CLC introduces temporal memory to support a sustainable crypto-economic model.

---

## 🌐 Project Status:

- **Open-source** and available on GitHub.
- Concept is public for community adoption and evolution.
- No live network or token issued yet.
- Project is at its ideation and research stage.
